# Number Control App

This is a simple React.js application that allows users to control a number between 0 and 150. The app features buttons to increment or decrement the number, a dynamic progress bar that visually represents the current number, and undo/redo functionality to revert or reapply changes.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Use buttons to increase or decrease the number by 1.
- **Progress Bar**: The progress bar updates dynamically based on the current number, with smooth animations.
- **Undo/Redo**: Allows users to undo the last operation or redo it if undone.
- **Number Constraints**: The number is constrained to stay between 0 and 150.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface and managing application state.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and adding animations to the progress bar.
